## Thesis topic description

In today's world of data excessiveness, it is challenging and important task to extract only the most valuable information from the surrounding data. To help people
extract information from a document and generate a short and concise text of it, text summarization became a researched area in Natural Language Processing. Text
summarizing is a useful tool for collecting key phrases and sentences that best represent the content, so it would be a powerful tool in education too, where the most
valuable information from a lecture can be difficult to locate.In extractive summarization, the model exploits the raw structures, sentences, and phrases of the text and
generates a concise summary, using only the source material without manual human intervention. The goal of this project is to utilize different Natural Language
Processing techniques, like contextual embeddings, the TextRank algorithm and the BERT model, to do extractive text summarization for lecture summarization.
